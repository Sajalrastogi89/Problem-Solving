# Intuition
The problem asks to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary search tree (BST). Since it's a BST, nodes with values less than the current node will be on its left subtree, and nodes with values greater than the current node will be on its right subtree. 

# Approach
The approach is to traverse the tree starting from the root. At each node, check if the current node's value falls between the values of the two given nodes `p` and `q`. If it does, then it is the lowest common ancestor. If not, move left or right based on the values of `p` and `q` to continue the search for the LCA.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
- Space complexity: O(1) if considering recursion stack space; otherwise, O(h) for the recursion stack space.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode find(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q){
        if (root.val >= p.val && root.val <= q.val)
            return root;
        return root.val > p.val ? find(root.left, p, q) : find(root.right, p, q);
    }
    
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        // Ensure p is less than q
        if (p.val > q.val) {
            TreeNode temp = p;
            p = q;
            q = temp;
        }
        return find(root, p, q);
    }
}
