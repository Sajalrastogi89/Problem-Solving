# Intuition
The problem aims to find the maximum depth of a binary tree, which represents the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node. The intuition to solve this problem is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree and keep track of the depth at each node.

# Approach
To solve the problem:
1. If the root node is null, return 0, indicating that the tree has a depth of 0.
2. Otherwise, recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left subtree and the right subtree.
3. Return the maximum depth among the left and right subtrees, incremented by 1 to account for the current level.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. We visit each node once.
- Space complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the binary tree. The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursive call stack, which is equal to the height of the tree.

# Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        // Base case: if root is null, return 0
        if(root == null)
            return 0;
        
        // Recursively calculate the maximum depth of left and right subtrees
        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);
        
        // Return the maximum depth among left and right subtrees, incremented by 1
        return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    }
}
