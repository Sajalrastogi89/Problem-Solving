# Intuition
The code appears to count the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the binary representation of the result of XOR operation between two integers `a` and `b`.

# Approach
The approach involves performing XOR operation between `a` and `b` to obtain a result `n`. Then, a loop iterates while `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration, we use a bitwise AND operation to clear the least significant set bit of `n` (setting it to 0) and increment a counter. This process continues until `n` becomes 0.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log(n)), where n is the maximum of `a` and `b`. The loop iterates until all the bits in `n` are cleared, which takes log(n) iterations.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize variables a and b
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        
        // Perform XOR operation between a and b
        int n = a ^ b;
        
        // Initialize a counter to count the set bits
        int count = 0;
        
        // Loop until all bits in n are cleared
        while (n > 0) {
            // Clear the least significant set bit of n using bitwise AND operation
            n = n & (n - 1);
            
            // Increment the counter
            count++;
        }
        
        // Print the count of set bits
        System.out.println(count);
    }
}
