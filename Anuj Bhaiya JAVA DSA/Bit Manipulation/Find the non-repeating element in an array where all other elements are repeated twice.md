# Intuition
The code appears to be finding the non-repeating element in an array where all other elements are repeated twice.

# Approach
The approach involves performing bitwise XOR (^) operation on all elements of the array. Since XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of any number with 0 is the number itself, the result will be the non-repeating element, as all other elements will cancel each other out due to their duplicates.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `A`. We iterate over each element of the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

# Code
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the array
        int[] A = {1, 1, 2, 4, 2, 5, 3, 5, 3};
        
        // Initialize the result variable
        int c = 0;
        
        // Iterate over each element of the array
        for (int i : A) {
            // Perform bitwise XOR operation with the result variable
            c ^= i;
        }
        
        // Print the non-repeating element
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
