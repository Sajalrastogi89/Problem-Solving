# Count Free Days

## Intuition
The problem involves counting the number of free days given the total number of days and a list of meetings. To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a greedy approach. We first sort the meetings based on their start times and then iterate through them, keeping track of the current end time. Whenever we encounter a gap between meetings, we add the duration of the gap to the total number of busy days. Finally, we subtract the total number of busy days from the total number of days to get the count of free days.

## Approach
1. **Sort Meetings**: Sort the meetings array based on their start times.
2. **Iterate Through Meetings**:
   - Initialize variables `totalBusyDays` and `currentEnd` to keep track of the total busy days and the end time of the last meeting.
   - Iterate through each meeting.
   - If the start time of the current meeting is greater than `currentEnd + 1`, there is a gap between meetings. Add the duration of the gap to `totalBusyDays`.
   - Update `currentEnd` to the end time of the current meeting.
3. **Calculate Free Days**: Subtract `totalBusyDays` from the total number of days to get the count of free days.
4. **Return Result**: Return the count of free days.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**:
  - $$O(n \log n)$$ for sorting the meetings array, where \( n \) is the number of meetings.
- **Space complexity**:
  - $$O(1)$$ constant space complexity for variables `totalBusyDays`, `currentEnd`, and other temporary variables.
  
## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int countDays(int days, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        int totalBusyDays = 0;
        int currentEnd = 0;
        
        for (int[] meeting : meetings) {
            int start = meeting[0];
            int end = meeting[1];
            
            if (start > currentEnd + 1) {
                totalBusyDays += (end - start + 1);
                currentEnd = end;
            } else {
                if (end > currentEnd) {
                    totalBusyDays += (end - currentEnd);
                    currentEnd = end;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int freeDays = days - totalBusyDays;
        return freeDays;
    }
}
