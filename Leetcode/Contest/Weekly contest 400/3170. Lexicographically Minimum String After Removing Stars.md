# Clear Stars in String

## Intuition
The problem requires removing '*' characters from the string while following a specific rule: deleting the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. We can efficiently solve this problem using a priority queue to keep track of the non-'*' characters and their order of appearance in the string.

## Approach
1. **Check for '*'**: If the input string does not contain any '*', return the string as it is.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Create a priority queue `pq` to store non-'*' characters in ascending order of appearance.
3. **Process String**: Iterate through each character of the string.
   - If the character is not '*', append it to the result string `result` and add it to the priority queue.
   - If the character is '*', check if the priority queue is not empty. If it is not empty, remove the smallest non-'*' character from the priority queue and delete its occurrence from the result string.
4. **Return Result**: Return the modified result string without any '*' characters.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**:
  - $$O(n \log n)$$ for iterating through the string and maintaining the priority queue, where \( n \) is the length of the input string.
- **Space complexity**:
  - $$O(n)$$ for storing the priority queue and result string.

## Code
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public String clearStars(String s) {
        if (!s.contains("*"))
            return s;
        
        PriorityQueue<Character> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c != '*') {
                result.append(c);
                pq.offer(c);
            } else if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                result.deleteCharAt(result.lastIndexOf(String.valueOf(pq.poll())));
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
