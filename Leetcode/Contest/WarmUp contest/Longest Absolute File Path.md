# Intuition
The intuition behind this solution is to simulate the file system structure by using a depth-based approach. We keep track of the length of the path at each depth using a HashMap.

# Approach
1. Initialize the longest path length to 0 and create a HashMap to store the length of the path at each depth.
2. Split the input string by newline character ('\n') to get individual lines.
3. Iterate through each line:
   - Remove tabs from the line to get the file or directory name.
   - Calculate the depth of the current file or directory by subtracting the length of the name from the length of the line.
   - If the name contains a '.', it represents a file, so update the longest path length if necessary.
   - Otherwise, update the HashMap with the length of the path at the next depth.
4. Return the longest path length found.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
  - Splitting the input string and iterating through each line takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.
- Space complexity: O(n)
  - Additional space is used for the HashMap to store the path lengths at each depth.

# Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int lengthLongestPath(String input) {
        int longest = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> pathMap = new HashMap<>();
        pathMap.put(0, 0);

        String[] lines = input.split("\n");

        for (String line : lines) {
            String name = line.replaceAll("\t", "");
            int depth = line.length() - name.length();

            if (name.contains(".")) {
                longest = Math.max(longest, pathMap.get(depth) + name.length());
            } else {
                pathMap.put(depth + 1, pathMap.get(depth) + name.length() + 1);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
}
