# Intuition
The problem seems to involve finding the minimum number of operations required to make the median of the array equal to a given value `k`.

# Approach
1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. If the median of the array is already equal to `k`, return 0.
3. If the median is greater than `k`, iterate through the first half of the array. For each element greater than `k`, add the difference between the element and `k` to the count of operations.
4. If the median is less than `k`, iterate through the second half of the array. For each element less than `k`, add the difference between `k` and the element to the count of operations.
5. Return the count of operations.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This complexity arises due to the sorting operation performed using `Arrays.sort(nums)`.
- Space complexity:
  - The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public long minOperationsToMakeMedianK(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        long count = 0;
        
        if (nums[nums.length/2] == k) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        if (nums[nums.length/2] > k) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= nums.length/2; i++) {
                if (nums[i] > k) {
                    count += (nums[i] - k);
                }
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= nums.length/2; i--) {
                if (nums[i] < k) {
                    count += (k - nums[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
