# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The intuition here is to iterate through the original string and make necessary replacements to create the lexicographically smallest string while adhering to the constraint of remaining changes.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Initialize a pointer to iterate through the original string and a StringBuilder to store the result.
2. Iterate through the original string while there are remaining changes and characters left.
3. For each character:
    - If it's 'a', append it to the result and continue.
    - Calculate the potential replacement bounds based on the current character and remaining changes.
    - Determine the replacement character and update the remaining changes accordingly.
    - Append the selected replacement character to the result.
4. Append any remaining characters of the original string to the result.
5. Return the final result string.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the original string. We iterate through the string once to make replacements.
- Space complexity:
  - The space complexity is also O(n) as we use a StringBuilder to store the result, which can grow up to the length of the original string.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public String getSmallestString(String originalString, int remainingChanges) {
        int currentIndex = 0; // Index to iterate through the original string
        StringBuilder resultString = new StringBuilder(); // String to store the result

        // Iterate through the original string until we have remaining changes or we reach the end of the string
        while (remainingChanges > 0 && currentIndex < originalString.length()) {
            char currentChar = originalString.charAt(currentIndex++); // Get the current character

            // If the current character is 'a', simply append it to the result and continue
            if (currentChar == 'a') {
                resultString.append(currentChar);
                continue;
            }

            // Calculate potential replacements based on the current character and remaining changes
            int replaceWithLowerBound = currentChar - remainingChanges; // Lower bound of potential replacement
            int replaceWithUpperBound = currentChar + remainingChanges; // Upper bound of potential replacement
            char replacementChar;

            // Determine the replacement character based on the bounds and update remaining changes
            if (replaceWithLowerBound < 'a' && replaceWithUpperBound > 'z') {
                // If both bounds exceed the limits, set replacement to 'a' and calculate remaining changes
                replacementChar = 'a';
                remainingChanges = Math.max('a' - replaceWithLowerBound, replaceWithUpperBound - 'z' - 1);
            } else if (replaceWithLowerBound < 'a') {
                // If only lower bound exceeds the limit, set replacement to 'a' and calculate remaining changes
                replacementChar = 'a';
                remainingChanges = 'a' - replaceWithLowerBound;
            } else if (replaceWithUpperBound > 'z') {
                // If only upper bound exceeds the limit, set replacement to 'a' and calculate remaining changes
                replacementChar = 'a';
                remainingChanges = replaceWithUpperBound - 'z' - 1;
            } else {
                // If replacement is within bounds, set it and reset remaining changes to 0
                replacementChar = (char) (currentChar - remainingChanges);
                remainingChanges = 0;
            }

            // Append the selected replacement character to the result
            resultString.append(replacementChar);
        }

        // Append the remaining characters of the original string to the result
        while (currentIndex < originalString.length()) {
            resultString.append(originalString.charAt(currentIndex++));
        }

        // Return the final result string
        return resultString.toString();
    }
}
