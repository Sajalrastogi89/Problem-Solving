# Remove Element Problem Solution

## Intuition
The problem asks us to remove all instances of a given value in an array in-place and return the new length of the array. Our intuition is to use a two-pointer approach where one pointer `j` points to the position where the next non-value element should be placed, and another pointer `i` traverses the array to check each element.

## Approach
We initialize `j` to 0, representing the new length of the array. Then, we iterate through the array with the pointer `i`. For each element `nums[i]`, if it's not equal to the given value `val`, we copy it to `nums[j]` and increment `j`. This effectively removes the value `val` from the array while maintaining the relative order of other elements.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We traverse the array once.
- Space complexity: O(1), as we're using only constant extra space.

## Code (Java)
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int j = 0; // Pointer for new length
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[j++] = nums[i]; // Move non-val element to position j
            }
        }
        return j; // New length of the array
    }
}
