# Intuition
This problem seems like a classic graph traversal problem, specifically depth-first search (DFS). We can iterate through each cell of the grid. Whenever we encounter a '1', we'll increment our island count and perform DFS to mark all adjacent '1's as visited.

# Approach
We'll iterate through each cell of the grid. Whenever we find a '1', we'll increment our island count and perform DFS to mark all connected '1's as visited. During DFS, we'll recursively explore the neighboring cells (up, down, left, right) of the current cell, marking them as visited if they are '1's.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. We visit each cell once.
- Space complexity: O(m * n) in the worst case, where all cells are '1's and the recursion stack reaches its maximum depth. 

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int numIslands = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    numIslands++;
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return numIslands;
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] != '1') {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[i][j] = '0'; // mark as visited
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j); // down
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j); // up
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1); // right
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1); // left
    }
}
