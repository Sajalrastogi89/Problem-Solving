# Reverse String

## Intuition
The problem of reversing a string can be approached using a recursive strategy. The main idea is to swap characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center. This divide-and-conquer approach simplifies the problem by reducing it to smaller subproblems.

## Approach
1. **Helper Function**: Create a helper function that takes the character array, the current index, and the length of the array.
2. **Base Case**: If the current index reaches the middle of the array (i.e., `i == n/2`), the recursion terminates.
3. **Swapping**: Swap the character at the current index with the character at the corresponding position from the end.
4. **Recursive Call**: Call the helper function with the next index.

By following this approach, the string will be reversed in-place using recursion.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  - $$O(n)$$ where \( n \) is the length of the string. Each character is swapped exactly once.
  
- **Space complexity**: 
  - $$O(n)$$ due to the recursion stack. The depth of the recursion will be \( n/2 \), which in the worst case is proportional to \( n \).

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public void swap(int a, int b, char[] s) {
        char temp = s[a];
        s[a] = s[b];
        s[b] = temp;
    }
    
    public void helper(char[] s, int i, int n) {
        if (i >= n / 2) {
            return;
        }
        swap(i, n - i - 1, s);
        helper(s, i + 1, n);
    }
    
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        helper(s, 0, s.length);
    }
}
