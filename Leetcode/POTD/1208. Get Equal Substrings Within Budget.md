# Equal Substring Within Budget

## Intuition
To solve the problem of finding the longest substring where the cost of converting one string to another is within a given budget, we can utilize a sliding window approach. This allows us to efficiently manage the costs and determine the maximum length of the valid substring.

## Approach
1. **Calculate Cost Array**:
   - Create an array `cost` where each element represents the absolute difference between the characters of the two input strings at corresponding positions.
   
2. **Initialize Sliding Window**:
   - Use two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the current window of the substring. Initialize `currentSum` to keep track of the total cost within the window and `maxLen` to store the maximum length of valid substrings found.
   
3. **Expand and Shrink Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer from the start to the end of the string.
   - Add the cost of the character at `end` to `currentSum`.
   - If `currentSum` exceeds `maxCost`, shrink the window by moving the `start` pointer to the right until `currentSum` is within `maxCost`.
   
4. **Update Maximum Length**:
   - Continuously update `maxLen` with the maximum length of valid substrings found during the iterations.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: 
  - The approach involves a single pass through the string for calculating the cost array and another pass using the sliding window technique, resulting in $$O(n)$$ time complexity, where $$n$$ is the length of the strings.
  
- **Space complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ due to the additional cost array of length $$n$$.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] cost = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate the cost array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cost[i] = Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - t.charAt(i));
        }

        int maxLen = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int start = 0;
        
        // Sliding window approach
        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            currentSum += cost[end];
            
            // If currentSum exceeds maxCost, shrink the window from the left
            while (currentSum > maxCost) {
                currentSum -= cost[start];
                start++;
            }
            
            // Calculate the maximum length of the substring
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}
