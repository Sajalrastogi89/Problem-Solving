# Intuition
The problem seems to involve finding a pivot integer in a sequence of integers. A pivot integer is one where the sum of integers before it is equal to the sum of integers after it.

# Approach
The approach taken here is to iterate through possible pivot integers starting from `n` and checking if the sum of integers before and after the pivot is equal. If found, return the pivot integer. If no such integer is found, return -1.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: 
  - The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the given integer. The algorithm iterates from `n` down to 1, performing constant-time operations for each iteration.
- Space complexity: 
  - The space complexity is O(1) since only a constant amount of extra space is used regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        for (int x = n; x > 0; x--) {
            int s1 = 0, s2 = 0;
            s1 = (x) * (x + 1) / 2;
            s2 = (n - x + 1) * (2 * x + (n - x)) / 2;
            if (s1 == s2)
                return x;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
