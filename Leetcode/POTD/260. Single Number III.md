# Single Number III

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. You can return the answer in any order. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Intuition
The XOR operation has properties that are very useful for solving this problem:
1. XOR of two identical numbers is 0 (e.g., `a ^ a = 0`).
2. XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself (e.g., `a ^ 0 = a`).

Using these properties, XORing all numbers in the array will result in the XOR of the two unique numbers since all duplicate numbers will cancel each other out.

## Approach
1. **Initial XOR Operation**:
   - Perform XOR on all elements of the array. This will give us the XOR of the two unique numbers since all duplicate numbers will cancel each other out.
   
2. **Find a Differentiating Bit**:
   - Find any bit that is set (i.e., 1) in the XOR result. This bit is guaranteed to be set in one of the unique numbers and unset (i.e., 0) in the other unique number. This can be done using `ans & -ans`, which isolates the rightmost set bit.
   
3. **Divide Numbers into Two Groups**:
   - Using the differentiating bit, partition the original array into two groups. One group contains numbers with the differentiating bit set, and the other group contains numbers with the bit unset.
   
4. **Find Unique Numbers**:
   - XOR all numbers in each group separately. Each group will contain one unique number and all duplicates from the original array. The duplicates will cancel out, leaving the unique numbers.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. We iterate over the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). We use a fixed amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            ans ^= i;
        }
        
        int differ = ans & -ans; // isolates the rightmost 1-bit
        int a = 0, b = 0;
        for (int i : nums) {
            if ((differ & i) == 0) {
                a ^= i;
            } else {
                b ^= i;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{a, b};
    }
}
