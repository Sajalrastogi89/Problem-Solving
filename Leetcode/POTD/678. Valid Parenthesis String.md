# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The intuition behind this problem is to keep track of opened and closed parentheses, along with asterisks, and ensure that the string is valid according to the given conditions.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The approach involves iterating through the string twice. First, we check for problematic ")" while tracking opened parentheses and asterisks. Then, we check for problematic "(" while tracking closed parentheses and asterisks.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. O(n) -->
The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s. This is because we iterate through the string twice, once from left to right and once from right to left.
  
- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. O(1) -->
The space complexity is O(1) because we use only a constant amount of extra space for storing integer variables opened, closed, and stars.

# Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        int opened = 0, stars = 0;

        // Check for problematic ")"
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == ')') {
                if (opened == 0) {
                    if (stars == 0) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    stars--;
                } else {
                    opened--;
                }
            } else if (ch == '(') {
                opened++;
            } else if (ch == '*') {
                stars++;
            }
        }

        // Check for problematic "("
        int closed = 0;
        stars = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == '(') {
                if (closed == 0) {
                    if (stars == 0) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    stars--;
                } else {
                    closed--;
                }
            } else if (ch == ')') {
                closed++;
            } else if (ch == '*') {
                stars++;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
