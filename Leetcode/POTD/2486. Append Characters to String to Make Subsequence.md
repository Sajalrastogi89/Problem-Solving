# Problem: Append Characters

## Intuition
The problem is about finding how many characters need to be appended to the string `s` to make `t` a subsequence of `s`. A subsequence means characters of `t` appear in `s` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively.

## Approach
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a pointer `j` to zero. This pointer will track our position in string `t`.
2. **Iterate Through `s`**: We iterate through each character in string `s` using a for loop.
3. **Matching Characters**: Inside the loop, if the current character of `s` matches the current character of `t` (pointed by `j`), we move the pointer `j` to the next character in `t`.
4. **Calculate Remaining Characters**: After the loop ends, `j` will be pointing to the position in `t` up to which we have found matching characters in `s`. The number of characters we need to append to `s` to make `t` a subsequence is the remaining characters in `t` from position `j` to the end of `t`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `s` and \(m\) is the length of `t`. This is because we iterate through both strings once.
- **Space complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of additional space for the pointer `j`.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int appendCharacters(String s, String t) {
       int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() && j < t.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return t.length() - j;
    }
}
