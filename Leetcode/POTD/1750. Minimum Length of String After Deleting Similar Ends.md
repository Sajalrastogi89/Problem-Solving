# Intuition
The problem aims to find the minimum length of a non-empty string after deleting characters. We can iterate through the string from both ends, checking if consecutive characters are the same. If they are, we can delete them and update the minimum length accordingly.

# Approach
We initialize two pointers, `i` starting from the beginning and `j` starting from the end of the string. We iterate until `j` crosses `i`, checking if consecutive characters are the same. If they are, we update `j` until we find a different character or `j` crosses `i`. We keep track of the minimum length encountered during this process.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - The algorithm iterates through the string once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Space complexity:
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for variables, so the space complexity is O(1).

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumLength(String s) {
        if (s.length() == 1)
            return 1;
        
        int n = s.length();
        int j = n - 1;
        char[] A = s.toCharArray();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n && j > i; i++) {
            char c = A[i];
            if (i > 0 && A[i] == A[i - 1])
                continue;
            int x = 0;
            while (A[j] == A[i] && j > i) {
                j--;
                x++;
            }
            if (x == 0)
                break;
        }
        
        return j - i + 1;
    }
}
