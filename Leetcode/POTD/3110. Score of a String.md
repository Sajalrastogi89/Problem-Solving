# Score of String

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, calculate the "score" of the string, where the score is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the ASCII values of consecutive characters in the string.

## Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and calculate the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive characters. The sum of these differences will give us the score of the string.

## Approach
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to keep track of the total score.
2. Loop through the string from the first character to the second-last character.
3. For each character, calculate the absolute difference between its ASCII value and the ASCII value of the next character.
4. Add this difference to the `sum`.
5. After the loop completes, return the `sum`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity**: \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the string. The loop runs `n-1` times.
- **Space complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int scoreOfString(String s) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++) {
            // Calculate the absolute difference between consecutive characters
            sum += Math.abs(s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i + 1));
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
