# Intuition
The problem asks to find the maximum depth of nested parentheses in a given string. This can be solved using a stack-based approach. We can iterate through the string, pushing '(' onto the stack when encountered and popping '(' from the stack when ')' is encountered. At each step, we update the maximum depth encountered so far.

# Approach
1. Initialize a stack to keep track of opening parentheses.
2. Initialize a variable `maxDepth` to keep track of the maximum depth encountered.
3. Iterate through the string character by character.
4. If the current character is '(', push it onto the stack and update `maxDepth` if necessary.
5. If the current character is ')', pop from the stack (if it's not empty).
6. Return `maxDepth` as the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input string `s`. We traverse the string once.
- Space complexity: O(n) in the worst case where n is the length of the input string `s`. This is because in the worst case, the entire string consists of opening parentheses, and hence the stack can contain all characters of the string.

# Code
```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        int maxDepth = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == '(') {
                stack.push(c);
                maxDepth = Math.max(maxDepth, stack.size());
            } else if (c == ')' && !stack.isEmpty()) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        
        return maxDepth;
    }
}
