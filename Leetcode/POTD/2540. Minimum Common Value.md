# Intuition
The intuition behind this approach is to iterate through both arrays simultaneously and compare elements at corresponding indices. If a common element is found, return it. If the element in the first array is greater than the element in the second array, move to the next element in the second array, and vice versa.

# Approach
The approach iterates through both arrays simultaneously using two pointers, `x` for the first array and `y` for the second array. If the elements at these pointers are equal, it returns the common element. If the element in the first array is greater, it increments the pointer for the second array, and if the element in the second array is greater, it increments the pointer for the first array.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n + m), where n is the length of nums1 and m is the length of nums2. The algorithm iterates through both arrays once.
- Space complexity: O(1). The algorithm uses constant extra space regardless of the input size.

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int getCommon(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        while (x <= nums1.length - 1 && y <= nums2.length - 1) {
            if (nums1[x] == nums2[y])
                return nums1[x];
            else if (nums1[x] > nums2[y])
                y++;
            else
                x++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
