# Counting Triplets with XOR Equal Zero

## Intuition
The problem involves finding the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` such that the XOR of the subarray from index `i` to `j-1` is equal to the XOR of the subarray from index `j` to `k`. This condition can be simplified by recognizing that if the XOR of the entire subarray from `i` to `k` is zero, then the required condition is met.

## Approach
1. Iterate through the array with two nested loops:
   - The outer loop sets the starting index `i`.
   - The inner loop, starting from `i + 1`, calculates the cumulative XOR from `i` to `k`.
2. If at any point the cumulative XOR is zero, the subarray from `i` to `k` satisfies the condition, and we add `(k - i)` to the count.

This approach effectively counts the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` by leveraging the property of XOR.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\) due to the two nested loops iterating through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we only use a few extra variables for counting and XOR calculations.

## Code
Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countTriplets(int[] arr) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int val = arr[i];
            
            for (int k = i + 1; k < arr.length; k++) {
                val = val ^ arr[k];
                
                if (val == 0) {
                    count += (k - i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
