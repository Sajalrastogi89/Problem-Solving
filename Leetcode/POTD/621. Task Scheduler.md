# Task Scheduler

## Problem Description
Given a char array representing tasks CPU need to do. It contains capital letters A to Z where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done without the original order of the array. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer `n` that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least `n` units of time between any two same tasks.

You need to return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

## Intuition
The problem seems to be asking for the minimum number of intervals required to complete all the tasks given certain constraints. One approach could be to schedule the tasks in such a way that tasks are spaced apart as much as possible to satisfy the given cooldown period.

## Approach
1. Count the frequency of each task.
2. Sort the tasks based on their frequency.
3. Determine the number of idle intervals required by considering the most frequent task (let's call its frequency `maxFreq`) and the cooldown period `n`.
4. Calculate the total intervals required considering the idle intervals.
5. Return the maximum of either the total intervals calculated or the total number of tasks, whichever is greater.

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of tasks. This complexity arises from sorting the tasks based on their frequency.
- Space complexity: O(1) since we are using a fixed-size array of size 26 to store the frequency of tasks.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] frequency = new int[26];
        
        // Count frequency of each task
        for (char task : tasks) {
            frequency[task - 'A']++;
        }
        
        // Sort tasks based on frequency
        Arrays.sort(frequency);
        
        // Get the maximum frequency
        int maxFreq = frequency[25];
        
        // Calculate idle intervals
        int idleIntervals = (maxFreq - 1) * n;
        
        // Fill in idle intervals with remaining tasks
        for (int i = 24; i >= 0 && idleIntervals > 0; i--) {
            idleIntervals -= Math.min(maxFreq - 1, frequency[i]);
        }
        
        // If there are still idle intervals left, add them to the total intervals required
        idleIntervals = Math.max(0, idleIntervals);
        
        // Return the maximum of either the total intervals required or the total number of tasks
        return tasks.length + idleIntervals;
    }
}
