# Maximum Minimum Importance Problem Solution

## Intuition
The problem can be solved using binary search. We can search for the maximum minimum importance by using binary search over the possible importance values. 

## Approach
1. Define a class `Solution` with a static method `maxMinImportance` that takes four parameters: `n` (number of elements), `r` (window size), `k` (number of available units), and `arr` (array of values).
2. Initialize `lo` to 0 and `hi` to the sum of `k` and the sum of all elements in `arr`.
3. Perform binary search until `lo` becomes greater than or equal to `hi`.
4. Calculate `mid` as the midpoint between `lo` and `hi`.
5. Initialize `p` to 0 and `kk` to `k`.
6. Clone the `arr` array into a new array `ss`.
7. Iterate over the combined array of `arr` and `r` additional elements.
8. Calculate the current prefix sum `p` and update it accordingly.
9. Check if `p` is less than `mid` starting from the `r`-th index.
10. If `p` is less than `mid`, adjust the values in the `ss` array and update `kk` accordingly.
11. If all conditions are met (`ok` is `true`), update `lo` to `mid`.
12. Otherwise, update `hi` to `mid - 1`.
13. Return `lo` as the maximum minimum importance.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n log(S)) where n is the number of elements in the `arr` array and S is the sum of all elements in `arr`. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log S) and the loop inside it has a linear time complexity.
- Space complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the `arr` array. Extra space is used for the cloned array `ss`.

## Code (Java)
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public static int maxMinImportance(int n, int r, int k, int[] arr) {
        long lo = 0, hi = k + Arrays.stream(arr).asLongStream().sum();
        
        while (lo < hi) {
            long mid = lo + (hi - lo + 1) / 2, p = 0;
            int kk = k;
            int[] ss = arr.clone();
            boolean ok = true;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < n + r; ++i) {
                if (i < n) 
                    p += ss[i];
                if (i >= 2 * r + 1) 
                    p -= ss[i - 2 * r - 1];
                if (i >= r && p < mid) {
                    if (kk < mid - p) {
                        ok = false;
                        break;
                    }
                    kk -= mid - p;
                    if (i < n) 
                        ss[i] += mid - p;
                    p = mid;
                }
            }
            
            if (ok) 
                lo = mid;
            else 
                hi = mid - 1;
        }
        
        return (int) lo;
    }
}
