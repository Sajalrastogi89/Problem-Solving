# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem involves finding the maximum dot product of two arrays by considering all possible combinations of elements from both arrays.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
The approach uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. We create a 2D array `dp` to store the maximum dot product at each step. We initialize the array with -1 to indicate that the values are not yet calculated. Then, we recursively calculate the maximum dot product by considering two cases: 
1. Taking the current elements from both arrays and adding their product to the maximum dot product obtained so far.
2. Not taking the current element from the second array and decrementing the gap if it is greater than 0.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. O(n * m) -->
The time complexity of the solution is O(n * m), where n is the length of the first array `a` and m is the length of the second array `b`. This is because we fill in the 2D `dp` array of size n * m and each cell takes constant time to compute.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. O(n * m) -->
The space complexity is O(n * m) because we use a 2D array `dp` of size n * m to store the intermediate results.

# Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxDotProduct(int n, int m, int a[], int b[]) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        for (int[] dr : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(dr, -1);
        }
        return solve(n - 1, m - 1, a, b, n - m, dp);
    }

    private int solve(int i, int j, int[] a, int[] b, int gap, int[][] dp) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0) return 0;
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];
        int take = a[i] * b[j] + solve(i - 1, j - 1, a, b, gap, dp);
        int not_take = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        if (gap > 0) not_take = solve(i - 1, j, a, b, gap - 1, dp);
        return dp[i][j] = Math.max(take, not_take);
    }
}
