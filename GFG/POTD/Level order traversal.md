# Intuition
My initial thoughts on solving this problem were to utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal technique to traverse the tree level by level. By using a queue data structure, we can process each level of the tree systematically, starting from the root node and continuing until all nodes have been visited.

# Approach
To implement the BFS traversal for the level order traversal of the tree:
1. Initialize an empty queue to store nodes to be processed.
2. Enqueue the root node into the queue.
3. While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue a node from the queue.
    - Add the value of the dequeued node to the result list.
    - Enqueue the left child of the dequeued node (if exists).
    - Enqueue the right child of the dequeued node (if exists).
4. Return the result list containing the level order traversal of the tree.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of the BFS traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- Space complexity: The space complexity of the BFS traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the space required for the queue data structure to store nodes at each level.

# Code
```java
class Solution
{
    //Function to return the level order traversal of a tree.
    static ArrayList<Integer> levelOrder(Node root) 
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans=new ArrayList<>();
        Queue<Node> A=new LinkedList<>();
        A.add(root);
        while(!A.isEmpty()){
            Node n=A.remove();
            ans.add(n.data);
            if(n.left!=null)
                A.add(n.left);
            if(n.right!=null)
                A.add(n.right);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
